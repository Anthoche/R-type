## 📋 Project Description

This project is a **multiplayer recreation of the classic R-Type game** in C++, built with a **client-server architecture** and a **custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) engine**.  
The goal is to reproduce a **retro shoot’em up** with smooth gameplay, precise collision handling, and robust network management.  

The project is divided into several modules:  
- **Client**: Handles rendering, player input, and synchronization with the server.  
- **Server**: Centralized game engine, responsible for world state, collisions, entities, and overall logic.  
- **ECS Engine**: Custom implementation of the Entity-Component-System model, ensuring a clear separation between data (components) and logic (systems).  

## Key Features  

- 🎮 **Multiplayer**: Supports multiple players connected via UDP.  
- 👾 **Classic gameplay**: Players, enemies, obstacles, and projectiles with full collision detection.  
- 🧩 **ECS system**: Modular entities, easily extendable (new enemy types, power-ups, etc.).  
- 🎨 **Rendering**: Sprites + debug rectangles (optional visible hitboxes).  
- 🛠️ **Authoritative server**: All collisions and game logic are validated server-side to prevent cheating.  
- 🔊 **Audio & effects**: Integration of sound effects and music (optional depending on configuration).  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Language & Libs

* **C++** - Development language
* **Raylib** - Graphical library
* **Asio** - Network library

### Compilation & Build

* **CMake** – Cross-platform build system and project configuration
* **VCPKG** - Cross-platform package manager for C++

### Testing

* **GoogleTest** – Unit testing framework

## 🔧 Development
### Available Scripts

#### 1. Install dependencies
vcpkg:

```bash
sudo dnf install ninja-build

sudo dnf install libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel mesa-libGL-devel pkg-config

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

#### 2. Build the project (Linux)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

##### 2.1. Build Unit Tests of the project
```bash
make tu
```

---

#### 🪟 2.2. Build the project (Windows)

If you are building with **Visual Studio 2022** and **CMake**, follow these steps:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build . --config Debug
cd Debug
```

Then launch the executables:

```bash
./rtype_server.exe [PORT]
./rtype_client.exe [IP ADDRESS] [PORT] [NAME]
```

📝 Example:
```bash
./rtype_server.exe 4242
./rtype_client.exe 127.0.0.1 4242 Paco
```

> ⚠️ On Windows, make sure `raylib`, `asio`, and other dependencies are properly installed via **vcpkg** and that your Visual Studio environment is correctly configured (x64 build tools).

---

#### 3. Launch the project (Linux)

3.1 server:
```bash
./rtype_server [PORT]
```

3.2 client:
```bash
./rtype_client [IP ADDRESS] [PORT] [NAME]
```

📝 Example:
```bash
./rtype_server 4242
./rtype_client 127.0.0.1 4242 Paco
```

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

### Common issues
#### 1. Missing OpenGL or X11 dependencies

Error: cannot find -lGL or X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory
➡️ Install missing dependencies:<br>
```sudo apt install libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev```

#### 2. Raylib linking errors

Ensure Raylib is properly fetched via vcpkg or submodules.
You can also install it manually:<br>
```sudo apt install libraylib-dev```

#### 3. Undefined references during linking

Clean your build folder and recompile:<br>
```rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make```

#### 4. Client window doesn’t open

Check that you’re not running in a headless environment (e.g., WSL without GUI).
You can use:<br>
```xeyes or glxinfo | grep OpenGL ```<br>
to verify X11/OpenGL works.

#### 5. I can't install the dependencies

if you're running on ubuntu try:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config git \
    libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
